# Learn Flutter (From Docs)

>Learning actually happens by building projects and even if it's just a simple egg timer app. I highly recommend you learn the basics of a programming language and then immediately start to build some real project like a calculator or a stopwatch. Whenever you then struggle with something use Google to find solutions and you will also learn that. This is what will really prepare you for the industry.
